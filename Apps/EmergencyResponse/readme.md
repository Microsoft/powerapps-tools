The Emergency Response solution provides a set of capabilities for healthcare organizations to collect data for situational awareness of available beds and supplies, COVID-19 related patients, staffing, and pending discharges. The solution also provides dashboards that provide insights to medical
organizations and hospitals to make informed decisions quickly resulting in efficient deployment and usage of resources.

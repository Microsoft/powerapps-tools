![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image13.png)

| Display Title | Purpose | Description |
|--|--|--|
|BAR\_AppSettings | Used for feature configuration by the admin of the app. Note: This list should be read-only for all members who aren't admins. | Admin configuration list for the *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR\_Buildings | Collection of all buildings. Includes information about total number of seats in the building, maximum allowed seats. Maximum allowed seats depend on the availability threshold %. | Building list for for the *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR\_Spaces| Collection of spaces associated with a building. A space is any bookable area within the building for example, a floor or a room. | List of bookable spaces for *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR_SafetyPrecautions  | Collection of information that a company wants to relay to employees. This list could hold safety precautions or company news. | Information list for *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR_KeyQuestions | Collection of screening questions that an employee must respond to before making a request to the building. This feature can be turned off from the admin app. | Key Questions for *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR_KeyQuestionAnswers | This list stores user responses to the key questions. | Answers for Key Questions List for *\[App Name\]* app. |
|BAR_Requests | This is the core lists which holds all access requests from users. The list holds key request information. | Request list for *\[App Name\]* app.AccessKey, Approver, BuildingID, CheckInTime, Created, DateValue, Modified,Requestor, Status fields are indexed in this list |


***Note***

-   *All these list columns should be considered as dependencies.
    Protect the lists from accidental schema changes (for example,
    adding new columns is allowed, but deleting columns might break the
    app.)*

-   *Use caution when deleting list items; deleting list items deletes
    historical records. You can turn the deprecation value toggle from
    No to Yes to drop records from contacts, news, FAQs, or links.*

### 

### Managing SharePoint 5000 Item Limit

It is essential that certain columns within the BAR\_Request list are
indexed. This is to avoid any delegation issues if the SharePoint lists
crosses the 5000 list items. Column indexing for Building Access App is
automatically set by the DeploySPLists flow.

For more information on SharePoint field indexing refer to this
[article.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-an-index-to-a-sharepoint-column-f3f00554-b7dc-44d1-a2ed-d477eac463b0)

SharePoint Security
-------------------

SharePoint lists should be configured using principal of least
privilege. This is to ensure that the users are only given privileges
that they require for seamlessly using the Apps in an intended way.

Refer to the permission matrix below to ensure users have right level of
access to the SharePoint lists.

| LISTS                  | USERS      | ADMIN      | SECURITY  |
|------------------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| BAR_AppSettings        | Read       | Read,Edit  | Read      |
| BAR_Buildings          | Read       | Read,Edit  | Read      |
| BAR_KeyQuestionAnswers | Read,Edit  | Read,Edit  | Read,Edit |
| BAR_KeyQuestions       | Read       | Read, Edit | Read      |
| BAR_Requests           | Read, Edit | Read, Edit | Read,Edit |
| BAR_SafetyPrecautions  | Read       | Read,Edit  | Read      |
| BAR_Spaces             | Read       | Read,Edit  | Read      |



In the above permissions matrix:

1.  Admins are users who use the Building admin app and are responsible
    for configuring key settings and reference data for the Building
    Access App.

2.  Users use the Building Access App. Users make reservation requests.
    Users are also managers who are responsible for approving the
    reservation requests.

3.  Security are users who use the Building Security App. They are
    responsible for building security and ensuring that users follow
    protocols by managing their entry to the building.

***Note***

-   *Currently SharePoint site has been configured as Public. This means
    all users in your organisation are members of the site.*

-   *Admins should be configured as owners of the site.*

-   *As the site is public, security users are already part of the
    members group of the site.*

Steps below show how to set up permissions for the BAR\_AppSettings
list. Same steps can be followed for other lists to provide access as
per the permission matrix above.

1.  Navigate to the SharePoint site.

2.  Click on the gear icon on top right and then click Site Contents.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

Set up an Admin Team
====================

It is important that you set up an admin team to centrally manage admin
tasks like, configuring key settings and reference data, approving
building access requests.

Building access requests are approved or rejected by requestor's manager
as defined in the Active directory. There might be instances where an
organisation's active directory doesn't hold this information for user.
In this case, Admin team will be responsible for approving or rejecting
building access requests.

Set up an Admin team following instructions in this
[article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/office/create-a-team-from-scratch-174adf5f-846b-4780-b765-de1a0a737e2b?ui=en-us&rs=en-ie&ad=ie).
It is recommended that you create a channel to manage building access
requests. To create a channel with your newly created admin team, follow
instruction in this
[article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/create-a-channel-in-teams-fda0b75e-5b90-4fb8-8857-7e102b014525?ui=en-us&rs=en-gb&ad=gb).

***Note***

-   *Ensure that right users are added to the admin team.*

-   *Generally, users using the Building Admin App and owners of the
    SharePoint site should be part of this team.*

Create initial content for the app
==================================

At this point, you\'ve successfully imported both the Building Access
App, Building Admin app and Building Security App. You can now start
creating the initial content. To start, open the Building Admin app.

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](.//media/image43.png)

You can use the admin app to customise all the key information required
in the Building Access app and to configure key settings for the app and
accompanying flows.

Set up key parameters under Settings
------------------------------------

To initialize your app, you need to provide all the required fields by
navigating to Settings.

Complete all the fields as shown in the following table, and then select
Save.

Sharing PowerApps
====================================================================================================================================================================

You need to share your PowerApps with relevant users in order to make
the apps available to use. For guidance on sharing a canvas app, refer
to this
[article.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app)

It is important that you share the apps with right users. As an example,

1.  Building Access app can be shared with all users in your
    organisation who are required to request access to a building.

2.  Building Admin can be shared with Facilities Admin users, who are
    responsible for managing key information like Buildings.

3.  Building Security can be shared with security personnel, who are
    responsible for managing entry to a building.

Deploying Building Access App to Teams
======================================

Deploying the Building Access App to teams is an easy way to promote
adoption, centralize discussions, and amplify information across the
organization. Teams Admins, as well as end-users, can add this app to
Teams, albeit with slightly different steps. Once you have downloaded
the app following the written or video instructions above, the steps
below walk through the process to deploy it to Teams.
